INCLUDE will get a whole Compose file included in your own application model, just like you did a full copy/paste. The only difference is that it will manage relative path references so that the included Compose file will be parsed the way the author expects, running from its original location. This capability makes it way easier for you to reuse content from another team, without needing to know the exact details.
