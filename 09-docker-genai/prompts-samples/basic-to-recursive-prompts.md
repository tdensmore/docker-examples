How can I be a good project manager?

---

I am not a professional project manager, but I need to lead a small IT project. I am not in charge of any financial considerations and am not tracking a budget. Which tasks should I complete to successfully manage this project?

Based on your previous response, which documents should I create to support this initiative?

I am not interested in a project charter, meeting minutes, or a project closure report. However, I would like to utilize the other suggestions. Can you provide a simplified template for my project?

The project name is Oracle Database Migration. Brandon is managing the project, with a start date of October 20th, 2025 and ending on January 15, 2026. The objective is to move a database from Oracle 19c to 23c during a 2-hour downtime.
The task list will consist of the architecture team performing the system design, the Linux team building the VM and installing OS, the storage team allocating storage, and the database team installing Oracle and configuring it. The database team will also do a dry-run migration of the database. The app team will use the new environment for dry-run testing.
A maintenance window will be determined and final data migration will occur. The application will be repointed to the new database. Milestones can be pulled from the task list as well. Each task is dependent upon the prior task being completed. We will have 1 team member from each team mentioned.
Communication will be via email and Teams with weekly meetings scheduled. We will report the project status back to stakeholders at a separate bi-weekly department project update meeting. Risks could consist of any delays in the OS build, storage availability, and issues with the dry run staying within the designated downtime window target.
Fill in the template with this information.
